# Coding Challenge 1: Summing Up to N in Three Ways

## Objective
Demonstrate your problem-solving and coding skills by writing three distinct functions in any programming language of your choice. Each function should sum up to the number n in a unique way.

## Tasks
1. Simple Summation Function: Write a function that takes an integer n and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n using a loop.

2. Recursive Summation Function: Write a recursive function to perform the same task: summing all integers from 1 to n.

3. Mathematical Formula Implementation: Implement a function that uses the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to find the sum of all integers from 1 to n.
